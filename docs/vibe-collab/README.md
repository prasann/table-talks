## 🔄 Organization

**Before**: 3 files (initial plan + mvp plan + design doc)
**After**: 2 focused files (concept/plan + current design)

This organization provides:
- **Clear separation**: Concept/planning vs technical implementation
- **Up-to-date docs**: Reflects current simplified architecture
- **Complete coverage**: From initial vision to current state
- **Easy maintenance**: Fewer files to keep synchronized

## 📊 Status
- ✅ All plans consolidated
- ✅ Current architecture documented  
- ✅ Technical details up-to-date
- ✅ Ready for future development
