Sample multi-tenant retail data files for schema comparison and testing.

- Each file represents a table for a specific tenant (us, eu, asia).
- Schemas are intentionally noisy: column names, order, and presence vary across tenants.
- Each file contains 40–50 columns and 20–30 rows of sample data.
- Use these files to test schema similarity/difference logic in your application.
